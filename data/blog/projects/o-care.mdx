We are developing an application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to assist in oral health 
care by detecting dental and tongue conditions through image classification. Maintaining oral health 
has broad implications for overall well-being. A healthy mouth is not only crucial for eating and 
speaking functions but also has a significant impact on one's social comfort and confidence. 

Additionally, good oral health is an integral part of general health, as issues like gum infections 
can potentially spread to other parts of the body, increasing the risk of heart diseases, diabetes, 
and complications during pregnancy. With this technology, you can quickly identify potential oral
 health issues, enabling early detection and timely preventive measures, saving significant costs
and time for future treatments.
